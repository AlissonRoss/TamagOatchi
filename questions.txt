Your project topic and how far you got with it

*My project is a pet game and I was able to get the class, buttons, intervals for animations to work

Any problems or difficulties you ran into and how you resolved them
*Had difficulties with animations. I tried many different ways to handle them and settled on using CSS transforms, transitions, etc.

What are some features you completed easily?
*I was able to get the props for the Scene Class (Originally was Oatchi Class) done pretty quickly! Adding local time was also very easy

What are some features you struggled with?
*Struggled with the intervals and animating. I asked ChatGPT lots of questions about it. I easily spent 15 hrs last week on the Javascript code and animations minimum

Things you learned (working together, working alone, process, content, syntax, etc)

*I learned about transitions between the Idle animation to by removing or adding to the CSS classList. I also had tick() to handle every action update

Why did you decide to create the project you did, and why did you choose the languages/libraries/frameworks you used.
*I choose to make a petgame because I personally really enjoy pet games. The animations were ambitious. 

If you could put 20 more hours of work into the project what would you do next?
*I would add death function to my pet once all values are depleted, and also fix some of the placeholder animations
I would also add a way to save the data to a JSON file
